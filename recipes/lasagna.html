    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Lasagna is one of my personal favorite dishes, the mix of cheese, meats and noodles 
        make it appetizing to even the most picky of eaters. Lasagna has a lot of set up and cook time but it is well worth it once you prepare and cook
        the perfect lasagna.

    <ul>
        <li>12 Lasagna Noodles </li>
        <li>3/4 pound of ground beef</li>
        <li>1 can of tomatoe paste</li>
        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound of italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 pound of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of fresh parsley</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage and ground beef with onion, and minced garlic over medium heat until meat turns golden brown. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and a cup of water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, italians seasoning, salt and pepper. 
            Simmer for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring lightly salted water to a boil and cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water for about 8 to 10 minutes. Once complete, drain the noodles and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine your ricotta cheese with an egg
            and remaining parsley.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 layer of noodles on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Add your ricotta cheese on top of the meat sauce and repeat these steps until you get 2-3 layers. Top the third layer with your mozzarella cheese and
             parmesan cheese. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li>With foil cover on top of the baking dish, place the dish in the center of the oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, take the foil off the top of the baking dish and re-insert dish to bake for another 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
